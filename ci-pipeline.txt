I'll help you create a GitLab CI pipeline for this project. Since you have a Docker Compose setup with multiple services, we'll need to create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that builds and tests your application.

Here's a basic `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to get you started:

```yaml:.gitlab-ci.yml
image: docker:20.10.16

services:
  - docker:20.10.16-dind

variables:
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: "/certs"
  DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2376
  DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY: 1
  DOCKER_CERT_PATH: "$DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR/client"

before_script:
  - docker info
  - docker compose version

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker compose build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - .

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - docker compose up -d
    - sleep 10  # Give services time to start
    - curl -f http://localhost:8765 || exit 1  # Basic health check
    - docker compose down
  dependencies:
    - build

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploy to production server"
  only:
    - main
  when: manual
```

To set this up, you'll need to:

1. Create the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your project root

2. Configure GitLab CI/CD variables in your project settings:
   - Go to Settings > CI/CD > Variables
   - Add any sensitive environment variables needed (like registry credentials)

3. If you want to push to a container registry, you'll need to add these variables:
   ```yaml
   CI_REGISTRY: your.gitlab.registry.url
   CI_REGISTRY_USER: registry-username
   CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: registry-password
   ```

4. For the deploy stage, you'll need to:
   - Set up SSH keys if deploying to a remote server
   - Add deployment credentials as CI/CD variables
   - Configure the deployment server details

5. Optional but recommended additions:
   - Add a `.dockerignore` file:
   ```text:.dockerignore
   .git
   .gitlab-ci.yml
   README.md
   node_modules
   ```

   - Add caching for Docker layers:
   ```yaml
   variables:
     DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1
     COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD: 1
   ```

6. If you're using a self-hosted GitLab instance, make sure:
   - GitLab Runner is properly configured
   - The runner has Docker executor enabled
   - The runner has sufficient permissions

Would you like me to provide more detailed configuration for any of these aspects or explain how to set up specific parts of the pipeline?
